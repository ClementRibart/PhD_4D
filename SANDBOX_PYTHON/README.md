# SANDBOX_CODE
*This is a personal repository where I put all my training scripts (Python, MATLAB) with key functions of each code
*All names of scripts are explicitly referring to key functions tested on basic examples
*I also comment each script to keep track of key notions and tricks I understood
*This is the first place where I should have a look when trying to understand functions/tricks about code
